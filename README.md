# Genascope

Genascope is a comprehensive web application designed to help identify individuals who may benefit from genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes. The platform consists of a chat-based risk assessment tool, eligibility analysis, lab integration features, patient invite management, user administration, and appointment scheduling capabilities.

## üîÑ Project Architecture

This project uses a unified full-stack architecture:
- **Frontend**: User interface built with Astro, React (TypeScript), and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI backend service with SQLAlchemy ORM and MySQL database
- **Database**: MySQL database with proper referential integrity and cascading operations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Docker**: Containerized development and deployment environment

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Risk Assessment**: Chat-based interface for collecting cancer risk factors
- **Eligibility Analysis**: Algorithms to determine testing eligibility based on NCCN guidelines and Tyrer-Cuzick model
- **Patient Invite System**: Comprehensive patient invitation and management workflow
- **Lab Integration**: Order genetic tests and view results
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Self-scheduling for patients and availability management for clinicians

### Administrative Features
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD operations for user accounts with proper data integrity
- **Account Management**: Tools for creating and managing organizational accounts
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for admin, clinician, lab tech, and patient roles
- **API Health Monitoring**: Real-time API status checking with fallback mechanisms

### Recent Improvements (June 2025)

## üìÖ Appointment Scheduling

The appointment scheduling system provides:

- **Patient Self-Scheduling**: Patients can book appointments after completing risk assessments or receiving test results
- **Clinician Availability Management**: Clinicians can set their recurring or one-time availability
- **Virtual & In-Person Appointments**: Support for both appointment types
- **Appointment Dashboard**: View and manage appointments for both clinicians and patients
- **Post-Assessment Integration**: Prompts to schedule appointments based on risk assessment results
- **Email Notifications**: Sends confirmations and reminders for appointments

## üöÄ Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                           |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...` | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI |

## üîå Backend Connection

This frontend is designed to work with the [genascope-backend](https://github.com/martialbb/genascope-backend) repository. To connect to the backend:

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Set `PUBLIC_API_URL` to point to your backend URL (default: http://localhost:8000)

For local development, both repositories should be cloned separately:

```sh
# Clone frontend (this repo)
git clone https://github.com/martialbb/genascope-frontend.git

# Clone backend repo (in a separate directory)
git clone https://github.com/martialbb/genascope-backend.git
```

## üê≥ Docker Development Setup

This application uses Docker for development with a complete full-stack setup including frontend, backend, database, and email services.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git for cloning the repository

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd genascope-frontend
```

2. **Environment Setup**:
```sh
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Copy backend environment template
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

3. **Start Development Environment**:
```sh
# Start all services using development configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

### Services Overview

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Frontend | http://localhost:4321 | Astro frontend application |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000 | FastAPI backend service |
| API Docs | http://localhost:8000/docs | Interactive API documentation |
| Database | localhost:3306 | MySQL database |
| MailDev | http://localhost:1080 | Email testing interface |

### Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**: Frontend and backend code changes are automatically reloaded
2. **Database Access**: Connect to MySQL at `localhost:3306` with credentials from `.env`
3. **Email Testing**: View sent emails at http://localhost:1080
4. **API Testing**: Use http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API testing

### Docker Commands

```sh
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Rebuild specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build backend

# Access database shell
docker exec -it genascope-frontend-db-1 mysql -u genascope -p genascope_db
```
cat > .env.development << EOF

### Using Docker for Development

The development setup provides hot-reloading for a seamless development experience:

```sh
# Start the development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Stop the development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Stop and remove volumes
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
```

### Using Docker for Production

The production setup optimizes for performance and security:

```sh
# Build and start the production environment
docker-compose up -d --build

# Stop the production environment
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# View logs for all services
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Environment Variables in Docker

You can configure the application using environment variables:

1. **For development**: Values in `.env.development` and overrides in `docker-compose.dev.yml`
2. **For production**: Values in `.env.production` and overrides in `docker-compose.yml`
3. **For both**: Runtime variables in `.env` file or passed via command line

Override any variable at runtime:
```sh
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://api.example.com docker-compose up -d
```

### Building a Standalone Image

Build and run the frontend container without docker-compose:

```sh
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t genascope-frontend:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -p 4321:4321 \
  -e PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-backend-url \
  -e PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://your-frontend-url \
  genascope-frontend:latest
```

### Docker Health Checks

The production configuration includes health checks for monitoring container health status:

```sh
# View container health
docker ps

# Detailed health check info
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' genascope-frontend_frontend_1 | jq
```
